# Hackathon #3: Superheroes ðŸ¦¹

> **Butâ€¦ what is a Hackathon?**
- Hacking is **creative problem solving**
- A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to **solve problems**
- Donâ€™t expect to have actually solved a problem by the end of the hackathon. **Real life problems are hard!** Think of the hackathon as a pit-stop on a long journey to solve problems or as a training session to practice your **problem solving skills**
